- My name is _Jaydev Singh Rao_ (Pronounced:  [[dʑɐj'deːʋ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Sanskrit)).
- I am an undergraduate student in _Dept. EECS_ at _[IISER Bhopal](https://iiserb.ac.in/)_, which is a higher education institute in Bhopal, India.
- I enjoy studying _Physics_ and _Computer Science_ and my academic interests lie at the bridge between these two domains.
- Right now, I am focused on trying to learn some cool techniques from computational physics and implementing those to solve problems I find interesting.
- Things that can easily lead to an hour (or more) long discussion with me
  - Physics, Computer Science and Mathematics.
  - The Julia programming language.
  - Biology of brain and evolution.
  - Political and existential philosophy.
