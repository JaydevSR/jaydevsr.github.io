- I enjoy studying _Physics_ and _Computer Science_ and my academic interests lie at the bridge between these two domains. I am focused on trying to learn some cool techniques from computational physics and implementing those to solve problems I find interesting.

---

- Things that I am working on right now
  - Studying the XY model and the Potts model using Monte-Carlo
  - Implementing REMD methods in [Molly.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/Molly.jl) (as part of GSoC 2022)
  If any of this is interesting to you as well let's get in touch.

- Things I don't like to stop talking about once started
  - Anything related to Physics, Computer Science and Mathematics (I mean it when I say anything).
  - How programming (especially in julia) is so fun.
  - The brain is f***ing awsome and evolution sucks and rocks at the same time.
  - Philosophy of existance (it gets dark pretty quick) and which form of government is the better than other.
