- I enjoy studying _Physics_ and _Computer Science_ and my academic interests lie at the bridge between these two domains. I am focused on trying to learn some cool techniques from computational physics and implementing those to solve problems I find interesting.

- Things that I am working on right now
  - Studying the XY model and the Potts model using Monte-Carlo
  - Implementing REMD methods in [Molly.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/Molly.jl) (as part of GSoC 2022)
  If any of this is interesting to you as well let's get in touch.
