- I am an undergraduate student in _Dept. EECS_ at _[IISER Bhopal](https://iiserb.ac.in/)_, India.
- I enjoy studying _Physics_ and _Computer Science_ and my academic interests lie at the bridge between these two domains. I am focused on trying to learn some cool techniques from computational physics and implementing those to solve problems I find interesting.
- Things that I am working on right now
  - Implementing REMD methods in [Molly.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/Molly.jl)
  - Studying the XY model and the Potts model using Monte-Carlo
  If any of this is interesting to you as well let's get in touch.
- Things that can easily lead to an hour (or more) long discussion with me
  - Physics, Computer Science and Mathematics.
  - How programming (especially in julia) is so fun.
  - The brain and evolution.
  - Philosophy of existance and which form of government is the better than other.
