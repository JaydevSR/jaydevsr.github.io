- My name is _Jaydev Singh Rao_. 
- I am an undergraduate student in _Dept. EECS_ at _[IISER Bhopal](https://iiserb.ac.in/)_, which is a higher education institute in Bhopal, India.
- I enjoy studying _Physics_ and _Computer Science_ and my academic interests lie at the bridge between these two domains[^1].
- I also like to make my computer do the job for me and always try to find new ways to do so. Recently I have picked quite a liking to pretty _graphical illustrations_, _shaders_ and _2D and 3D generative art_[^2] which is quite fun so far.
- Other than this I do most of the things that people to _pass their time_.
